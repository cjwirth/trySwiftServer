# Soaring Swiftly
## Server Side Swift

Caesar Wirth, March 4, 2016, try! Swift, Tokyo, Japan

This is the sample code that I put together for my talk. 
I also have the slides included, that includes the information for deploying to heroku.

I'll eventually also get a blog post up about how to get Xcode to be able to read your dependencies, since it can be a little weird to get set up.
