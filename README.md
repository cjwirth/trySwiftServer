# Soaring Swiftly
## Server Side Swift

Caesar Wirth, March 4, 2016, try! Swift, Tokyo, Japan

This is the sample code that I put together for my talk. 
I also have the slides included, that includes the information for deploying to heroku.

Just cloning this, it's possible that Xcode won't be able to see the dependencies. You will have to manually run `swift build` before it will be able to find them. 

I've also written a [blog post](http://http://cjwirth.com/2016/03/07/using-xcode-and-spm-together/) about getting Xcode to read your spm dependencies, which might help as well.
